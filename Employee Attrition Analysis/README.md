# 🧠 Employee Attrition Analysis (HR Analytics)

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition** — understanding why employees leave a company, which factors influence attrition, and how HR teams can take data-driven actions to improve retention.

The analysis was conducted using **Excel**, applying data analytics techniques including formulas, pivot tables, and visualization tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors that contribute to employee attrition.
- Understand the relationship between **salary, job satisfaction, and years of experience**.
- Provide insights to help HR teams **predict and prevent attrition**.
- Strengthen hands-on skills in **Excel-based analytics and business interpretation**.

---

## 🧩 Dataset Overview
- Source: HR Employee Dataset (Kaggle)
- Size: ~1,400 records
- Key Columns:
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Department`, `Education`, `YearsAtCompany`
  - `MonthlyIncome`, `JobSatisfaction`, `WorkLifeBalance`, `Attrition`
  - `OverTime`, `MaritalStatus`, `JobRole`

## ⚙️ Steps & Techniques Used

### 1️⃣ **Data Cleaning**
- Removed missing or duplicate entries.
- Normalized categorical fields (e.g., “Sales Executive”, “Research Scientist”).
- Ensured numerical consistency (e.g., monthly income as integer).

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Analysis (Excel Formulas)**
- Used **AVERAGE, MEDIAN, COUNTIF, IF** for descriptive analysis.
- Applied **XLOOKUP**, **INDEX-MATCH** to find employee-specific insights.
- Built relationships between salary and attrition rate.

### 3️⃣ **Visualization (Pivot Tables & Charts)**
- Created pivot tables to summarize:
  - Attrition by **Department**, **Job Role**, and **Salary Bracket**.
  - Average satisfaction across departments.
- Used **Clustered Bar Charts** and **Pie Charts** to visualize:
  - Attrition distribution.
  - Work-life balance satisfaction.
  - Gender and age group trends.

### 4️⃣ **Power Query**
- Loaded data dynamically using Power Query.
- Transformed and refreshed data models without manual rework.
- Demonstrated real-world automation for HR dashboards.

## 📊 Key Insights
| Observation | Business Insight |
|--------------|------------------|
| High attrition among employees with overtime | Indicates **workload management issue** |
| Lower satisfaction in Sales roles | Suggests **need for incentive or recognition programs** |
| Employees with <2 years experience leave most | HR should **focus on early engagement programs** |
| Mid-level income group shows highest attrition | Possible **market pay gap** issue |
| Work-life balance strongly correlates with attrition | Reinforces **flexibility and hybrid work importance** |

---

## 💡 Achievements
